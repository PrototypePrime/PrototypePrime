### 🚀 Future Focus & Professional Connection

My current professional goal is the deeper integration of intelligent automation and AI into the detection and **Threat Hunting** lifecycle, moving our defenses from reactive analysis to **predictive threat mitigation**.

**🎯 Upcoming Focus:** I am actively developing a **Splunk App for threat intelligence ingestion and visualization**, aiming to package and submit it to **Splunkbase** for broader distribution and community impact.

I am always open to connecting with fellow professionals to discuss innovative approaches to scalable detection, hypothesis-driven Threat Hunting, or to explore new frontiers in security automation.
