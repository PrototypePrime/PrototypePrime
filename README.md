### 🚀 Future Focus & Professional Connection

My current professional goal is the deeper integration of intelligent automation and AI into the detection and **Threat Hunting** lifecycle, moving our defenses from reactive analysis to **predictive threat mitigation**.

**🎯 Recent Achievement:** Successfully built and deployed **Event-Horizon**—a production-quality security log generator that supports 80+ platforms and enables realistic attack simulation for comprehensive detection testing.

**🎯 Upcoming Focus:** I am actively developing a **SOC-focused Splunk App for Security Operations Centers**, designed to enhance threat intelligence ingestion, visualization, and operational workflows. I aim to package and submit it to **Splunkbase** for broader distribution and community impact.

I am always open to connecting with fellow professionals to discuss innovative approaches to scalable detection, hypothesis-driven Threat Hunting, security tool development, or to explore new frontiers in security automation and testing methodologies.
