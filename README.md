### ✨ Project Showcase

My portfolio demonstrates expertise across the full detection engineering lifecycle—from building custom, high-fidelity detection rules to engineering specialized tools that enable rapid testing, validation, and training.

| Project Name | Key Technology/Skill Used | Strategic Description | Code Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Splunk SPL Detection** | Splunk SPL/SIEM Optimization | Architecting 50+ high-fidelity correlation rules to eliminate noise and zero in on advanced threats, resulting in a **40% reduction in Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** for critical incidents. | ➡️ **[View Code](https://github.com/PrototypePrime/Splunk_SPL_Detection)** |
| **Event-Horizon** | Security Engineering/Testing | Built a production-quality security log generator supporting **80+ platforms** (Firewalls, Cloud, Endpoints, Web/Proxy) with template-first design and **AI-powered attack simulation**—enabling realistic kill-chain testing, detection validation, and SOC training at scale (1M+ logs in minutes). | ➡️ **[View Code](https://github.com/PrototypePrime/Event-Horizon)** |
| **Microsoft Defender KQL Detection** | Defender KQL/Cloud Security | Developing complex KQL hunting queries that **anticipate and flag suspicious M365 activity** (e.g., mail rule changes, OAuth abuse) to halt modern phishing campaigns at the earliest stage. | ➡️ **[View Code](https://github.com/PrototypePrime/Microsoft_Defender_KQL_Detection)** |
| **Cortex XDR XQL Detection** | Cortex XDR XQL/EDR | Engineering behavioral detection logic specifically designed to **thwart stealthy fileless attacks** and living-off-the-land tactics that evade standard signatures. | ➡️ **[View Code](https://github.com/PrototypePrime/Cortex_XDR_XQL_Detection)** |
| **Custom AI-Powered GPT** | Prompt Engineering/LLMs | A specialized, knowledge-based GPT designed to **democratize complex security expertise** for the team, significantly streamlining analyst workflows and policy adherence checks. | ➡️ **[View Code](https://github.com/PrototypePrime/Custom_AI-Powered_GPT)** |

### 🚀 Future Focus & Professional Connection

My current professional goal is the deeper integration of intelligent automation and AI into the detection and **Threat Hunting** lifecycle, moving our defenses from reactive analysis to **predictive threat mitigation**.

**🎯 Recent Achievement:** Successfully built and deployed **Event-Horizon**—a production-quality security log generator that supports 80+ platforms and enables realistic attack simulation for comprehensive detection testing.

**🎯 Upcoming Focus:** I am actively developing a **Splunk App for threat intelligence ingestion and visualization**, aiming to package and submit it to **Splunkbase** for broader distribution and community impact.

I am always open to connecting with fellow professionals to discuss innovative approaches to scalable detection, hypothesis-driven Threat Hunting, security tool development, or to explore new frontiers in security automation and testing methodologies.
